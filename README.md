A piece of code dedicated to solving the Collatz conjecture.
It generates random number up to 10 to the power of 1000 quickly and applies the rules.
If you don't know what the Collatz conjecture is, let me explain it to you. It's 3n+1. If you have an even number, divide it by 2.
If you have an odd number, multiply it by 3 and add 1. No matter how many times you do it, you will eventually get 1. But this remains unsolved. So i made this code and hopefully this will solve it. Please report any improvements at the Issues page :) 
Update: I made a new manual version! collatz_manual.py Just run the script and keep trying different inputs â€” it loops until you type "exit".
